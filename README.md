A unique variant of UNO where having **no cards means you lose** instead of winning.  
This turns UNO into a survival strategy game where keeping cards in hand is the goal.

---

## Objective

Survive the longest with cards in your hand.  
The game ends when a player has **no cards left — that player loses**.  
The last remaining player with cards wins.

---

## Setup

- Use a **standard UNO deck** (108 cards).  
- Each player starts with a **minimum of 7 cards**.  
- No picking up cards 
- Extra cards held by players do not matter — you cannot voluntarily draw cards.

---

## Rules

1. **Normal Play**  
   - Match number or color, or play a wild card (same as regular UNO).

2. **No Matching Cards**  
   - If a player cannot match the number or color of the top card, they **must throw 2 cards of their choice** to the discard pile.

3. **+ Card Rule (+2, +4)**  
   - When a + card is played, the **next player must give the same amount of cards** (2 or 4) of their choice to the thrower instead of drawing cards.  
   - The thrower **cannot stack cards**: they can only play **one + card per turn**.  
     Example: Player A plays +2 → Player B plays +2 → Player C must give **4 cards** to Player B if Player C don't have +2

4. **Skip Card**  
   - The next player must **throw one extra card** when it is their turn. No transfer of punishment, the effect will be consumed immediately and is limited to the next player only.
     Example: Player A plays skip -> Player B plays two card.

5. **Special Cards (Wild, Reverse)**  
   - Same effect as in regular UNO. Just an extra way to survive.

6. **Mistake**
   - On mistake like mismatch color, wrong card or mistake number *(regular mistakes)* will result in dumping 2 cards in dump stack
---

## Game Flow

1. Players take turns matching the top card in the discard pile by color or number.  
2. Special card effects are applied immediately when played.  
3. No stacking by the thrower.  
4. Play continues until one player has **no cards left**, ending the game.
5. All punishments and extra cards must follow the existing uno rules of matching either colour or number.

---

## Winning

- The **last player with cards in hand wins**.  
- The first player to run out of cards loses.

---

## Why Play UNO Reverse Survival?

This variant flips UNO into a **strategic survival game** rather than a race to empty your hand.  
It adds tension, strategy, and new dynamics to every match.

## Age Limit 

* **Official recommendation by Mattel (UNO creator)**: Ages **7+**.

  * Because the game requires some basic number recognition, color matching, and understanding of rules.

* **Younger kids (4–6 years)** can play a simplified version of UNO with fewer rules and fewer cards.

  * Parents sometimes adapt rules so it’s easier for kids to understand.

* **Older kids, teens, and adults**: UNO is popular across all ages because it’s fast, social, and easy to learn.

**Summary**: Officially recommended **7 years and up**, but adaptable for all ages depending on rule complexity.
