A unique variant of UNO where having **no cards means you lose** instead of winning.  
This turns UNO into a survival strategy game where keeping cards in hand is the goal.

---

## Objective

Survive the longest with cards in your hand.  
The game ends when a player has **no cards left — that player loses**.  
The last remaining player with cards wins.

---

## Setup

- Use a **standard UNO deck** (108 cards).  
- Each player starts with a **minimum of 7 cards**.  
- No picking up cards 
- Extra cards held by players do not matter — you cannot voluntarily draw cards.

---

## Rules

1. **Normal Play**  
   - Match number or color, or play a wild card (same as regular UNO).

2. **No Matching Cards**  
   - If a player cannot match the number or color of the top card, they **must throw 2 cards of their choice** to the discard pile.

3. **+ Card Rule (+2, +4)**  
   - When a + card is played, the **next player must give the same amount of cards** (2 or 4) of their choice to the thrower instead of drawing cards.  
   - The thrower **cannot stack cards**: they can only play **one + card per turn**.  
   - Others **can stack**: if another player has a + card of the same type immediately after, they may play it, increasing the card requirement for the next player.  
     Example: Player A plays +2 → Player B plays +2 → Player C must give **4 cards** to Player B.

4. **Skip Card**  
   - The next player must **throw one extra card** when it is their turn.

5. **Special Cards (Wild, Reverse)**  
   - Same effect as in regular UNO.

---

## Game Flow

1. Players take turns matching the top card in the discard pile by color or number.  
2. Special card effects are applied immediately when played.  
3. No stacking by the thrower.  
4. Play continues until one player has **no cards left**, ending the game.

---

## Winning

- The **last player with cards in hand wins**.  
- The first player to run out of cards loses.

---

## Why Play UNO Reverse Survival?

This variant flips UNO into a **strategic survival game** rather than a race to empty your hand.  
It adds tension, strategy, and new dynamics to every match.
